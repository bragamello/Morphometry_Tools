# Morphometry Tools
This is a set of tools to produce and analyze meshes of the cortical surface using only python libraries.

# 1. Visual Inspection
Before the data analysis, sometimes it is necessary to visually check the plausibility of th surface automatically reconstructed by some software.

# 2. Extract Hemisphere
Extract morphological variables from Freesurfer meshes in a hemisphere basis

# 3. Extract Lobes
Extract morphological variables from Freesurfer meshes in a hemisphere/lobe basis
