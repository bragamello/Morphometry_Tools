This function produces a smooth outer pial surface. It is a pythonic version of the smooth pial obtained with the LocalGI Matlab script

For multiple subjects it assumes a flattened file organization (all subjects and sessions
at the same folders as subj1_ses1, subj1_ses2, subj2_ses1 ...)


based on: A Surface-Based Approach to Quantify Local Cortical Gyrification, Marie Schaer et. al. in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, vol. 27, no. 2, pp. 161-170, Feb. 2008, doi: 10.1109/TMI.2007.903576
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4359040

It has the option to save the generated surface (~5.3 MB per subject)

TO DO:
1) include longitudinal file organization

2) Calculate the Local girification index
